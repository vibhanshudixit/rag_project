# Hybrid RAG App (Streamlit + Pinecone + Cohere ReRank)

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** app built with **Streamlit**.  
It lets you upload PDF or text documents, indexes them into Pinecone, and provides a chatbot-style interface that answers your questions using a **hybrid retriever** (dense + sparse) with **Cohere Reranking** and **Groq LLMs**.


To access the frontend on StreamLit Cloud: https://ragproject-vibhanshu.streamlit.app/
To access the pinecone vector DB:

## Features
- Upload **PDF** or **TXT** documents directly in the Streamlit app.
- Extracts and chunks document text intelligently using **LangChain** (semantic + recursive splitting).
- Builds a **hybrid retriever**:
  - Dense retrieval with **Pinecone + HuggingFace embeddings**
  - Sparse retrieval with **BM25**
  - **Cohere Rerank** for final scoring
- Query documents with inline citations, answers, and metadata.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hybrid-rag-app.git
cd hybrid-rag-app
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```env
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

---

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run frontend.py
```

Then open the link (usually `http://localhost:8501/`) in your browser.

## Notes

* GPU acceleration (CUDA) will be used automatically if available.
* Uploaded documents are saved locally under `uploaded_docs/`.
* Pinecone index name defaults to `rag-index` but can be adjusted in `pipeline.py`.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Start the app (`streamlit run frontend.py`)
2. Upload one or more PDFs/TXT files
3. Ask a question about the documents
4. Get an AI-generated answer with inline citations and retrieved metadata

Got it 👍 — here’s a **more concise, human-friendly** version (2–3 points each):

###  Remarks

* **Limits**:

  - Since we rely on Pinecone, there are API limits, costs, and occasional latency issues.
  - Chunking large documents sometimes loses important context.
  - Retrieval quality is only as good as the embeddings + reranker we use.

* **Trade-offs**:

  - Pinecone gives us scalability and persistence, but it’s more expensive than local options like FAISS.
  - Hybrid retrieval (Pinecone + BM25 + Cohere ReRank) improves accuracy, but adds extra complexity and latency.
  - Modular design makes it flexible to extend, but production setups would need tighter control and monitoring.

* **Next Steps**:

  - Tune Pinecone for a better balance of cost, speed, and accuracy.
  - Add caching so repeated queries don’t keep hitting Pinecone.
  - Explore smarter pipelines (like document-type awareness or GraphRAG) to make retrieval more context-aware.
